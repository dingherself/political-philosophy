<h2 class="mt-2">Excused Absences</h2>

Please email me if there is a reason you can’t come to class, but you *don’t* need to show me any kind of documentation. This is an honor system, and I trust you not to abuse it—all I ask is you also be flexible and considerate when you are in a position of power to do so.

## Late Assignments, Extensions, and Make-Ups

No late assignments will be accepted, but an extension will ordinarily be granted as long as you (1) have a clear plan for completing the assignment and (2) let me know your plan by email **no later than 6 hours before the deadline** (unless the delay is justified). Likewise, there is no need to show me any kind of documentation.

As an instructor, I always appreciate students asking for extensions ahead of time when possible. Make-ups for missed assignments after the fact are generally disfavored, and will be granted only to accommodate emergencies and other unexpected circumstances, such as health (including mental health), child care, and family emergencies. We can always work something out, but it’s important that you contact me as soon as you can.

## Academic Integrity

### The Barnard Honor Code

Approved by the student body in 1912 and updated in 2016, the Code states:

> We, the students of Barnard College, resolve to uphold the honor of the College by engaging with integrity in all of our academic pursuits. We affirm that academic integrity is the honorable creation and presentation of our own work. We acknowledge that it is our responsibility to seek clarification of proper forms of collaboration and use of academic resources in all assignments or exams. We consider academic integrity to include the proper use and care for all print, electronic, or other academic resources.
> We will respect the rights of others to engage in pursuit of learning in order to uphold our commitment to honor. We pledge to do all that is in our power to create a spirit of honesty and honor for its own sake.

### Plagiarism

**I view plagiarism as a *very* serious violation of the Barnard Honor Code, and you should as well.** I strongly encourage you to review this helpful guide: <https://lib.arizona.edu/research/sources/plagiarism>{: .text-break}. I understand different instructors may draw the line somewhat differently; if you have any questions about what constitutes plagiarism for purposes of our course, please don’t hesitate to ask me.

### Use of generative AI tools

I consider it an important component of digital literacy that students appreciate the strengths as well as limitations and real-world impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT.

For philosophy in particular, while generative AI tools may be very useful for finding the right phrase, clarifying and polishing prose, coming up with examples, brainstorming objections, and outlining and summarizing texts that the user puts in, they are prone to fabricate facts, misunderstand views, produce word salads, maintain forced neutrality and balance of sides, default to popular rather than critical, considered perspectives, and approach issues in ways uninformed by our course materials and class discussions. To experienced and sophisticated readers of philosophy, these are not only telltale signs, but serious problems with both the writing and the substance.

In addition, we are only beginning to understand the ethical issues behind the [data](https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/7/27/23808499/ai-openai-google-meta-data-privacy-nope) used to train generative AI tools and the [racism](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/ai-generated-images-bias-racism-sexism-stereotypes/), [sexism](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/generative-ai-unesco-study-reveals-alarming-evidence-regressive-gender-stereotypes), [cisheterosexism](https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-lgbtq-representation-openai-sora/), and [ableism](https://blog.apaonline.org/2023/03/30/ableism-and-chatgpt-why-people-fear-it-versus-why-they-should-fear-it/) that these tools then inherit. The environmental costs of the infrastructure on which generative AI tools run are concerning as well—including, for example, their staggering [water](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-energy-demands-water-impact-internet-hyper-consumption-era/) and [energy](https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/28/24111721/climate-ai-tech-energy-demand-rising) consumption.

My own policy is to prohibit students from turning in *as their own work* either (1) passages (beyond a single word or phrase) directly produced by generative AI tools, or (2) ideas, arguments, distinctions, claims, analyses, and the like substantially informed by their use of generative AI tools. **Just for purposes of academic integrity, the most salient consideration to me is *misrepresentation*: what I care about is whether a student’s failure to acknowledge the origin of a passage or idea is likely to mislead, that is, to falsely imply that the student has written or come up with it themself.** Contrast this with searching “synonyms for ‘retroactive laws’ ” on Google and with brainstorming ideas for a paper with a friend. In the Google case, acknowledgment is unnecessary because no one would think the phrase ‘*ex post facto* laws’ is therefore implied to have been invented by the student (but if the student uses a *specific* way of explaining what it means for laws to be *ex post facto*, which they have found through the Google search, then that would require proper citation). In the friend case, acknowledgment is necessary because the friend is a significant reason that the student could think of the paper idea in the first place (this is even more obvious when the friend helps the student to come up with specific ways of putting the idea into words).

## Respect, Support, and Care for One Another

### Materials in this course

Since many of the issues we will cover in this course are not only intellectually but also personally relevant, you might find it difficult to read and discuss certain course materials. I want to acknowledge that. It’s perfectly understandable.

It’s therefore important that we respect, support, and care for one another throughout the course. Please always feel free to talk to me if you anticipate certain topics will be especially difficult for you, or if you think the way they get discussed in class is disrespectful or otherwise problematic.

### (Lack of) diversity in philosophy

Unfortunately, philosophy as an institutionalized discipline is remarkably white, cis male, straight, able-bodied, and middle-class. This lack of diversity is often apparent just from the topics and authors typically taught in introductory philosophy courses. However, philosophy as a whole is becoming more and more diverse thanks to the efforts of several generations of philosophers. As a philosophy student, you can also help the profession address its diversity and inclusiveness problems by seriously engaging with marginalized authors and supporting your fellow students.

The American Philosophical Association (APA) has a useful handout for marginalized undergraduate students in philosophy, which you can read here: <https://www.apaonline.org/resource/resmgr/diversity/Advice_for_Undergrads.pdf>{: .text-break}.

### Some concrete examples

Class discussions

- Value everyone’s contribution to class discussions;
- Disagree in a way that takes other people’s ideas seriously and sincerely;
- Challenge remarks, jokes, and examples that are racist, sexist, heterosexist, cissexist, misogynistic, transmisogynistic, xenophobic, ableist, ageist, classist, etc.;
- Keep discussions inclusive by avoiding talking to only a few specific people.

Classroom behavior

- Try to remain quiet if you have to arrive late or leave early;
- Avoid starting to pack things up until class is completely over;
- Listen attentively and avoid distracting or interrupting behavior, such as chatting with the person next to you or checking your phone.

Gender & sexual orientation

- Use the pronouns and name you are asked to when you refer to a person, and avoid assuming a person’s pronouns, gender identity, or sexual orientation based on their appearance, voice, or name;
- Be careful not to disclose anyone’s gender identity or sexual orientation (i.e., out them) without their permission, even if they are already out in the classroom—it can put lives in danger;
- Never inquire about anyone’s genitalia, deadname, “before” photos, medical history, assigned gender at birth, sex life, and so on;
- Use inclusive language (for helpful examples, see <https://www.apaonline.org/page/nonsexist>{: .text-break} and <https://transjournalists.org/style-guide>{: .text-break}).

If you feel any aspect of this course makes it difficult for you to participate fully, I want to know. This is *very* important to me.

## Wellness Statement

It is important for undergraduates to recognize and identify the different pressures, burdens, and stressors you may be facing, whether personal, emotional, physical, financial, mental, or academic. We as a community urge you to make health, sanity, and wellness--your priority throughout this term and your career here. Sleep, exercise, and eating well can all be a part of a healthy regimen to cope with stress. Resources exist to support you in several areas of your life, and we encourage you to make use of them.
