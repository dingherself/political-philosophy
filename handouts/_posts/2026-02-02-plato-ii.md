## Philosophy rules?

[Ding’s Trivia Corner](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WU3srU6u2Ijl-puqv-DhJb1Qqs5u3bt8pOKJqwy4aIY/edit?usp=sharing)

The ship analogy:

- *Statesman*, 296e–297b: “A ship’s captain is constantly trying to ensure the best interests of his ship and crew; the way he keeps everyone on board safe is not by giving them written rules to follow, but by making his expertise available to them.”
- *Republic*, 488a–489a: Sailors fighting each other to become captain without realizing that “any genuine sea-captain has to study the yearly cycle, the seasons, the heavens, the stars and winds, and everything relevant to the job. . . . When this is what's happening on board ships, don’t you think that the crew of ships in this state would think of any true captain as nothing but a windbag with his head in the clouds, of no use to them at all?”

A hypothetical argument: *If* rule by expertise is unavailable, and *if* government has no regard for established law, then it’s best to live in a democracy.

- Consent of the ruled is irrelevant; epistemic authority grounds political authority (doctor analogy). [Sophia, Sitong]
